# ğŸ“š Tech Notes

Welcome to my personal tech notes repo ğŸ§ âš¡  
These notes are built for **quick recall, clarity, and core understanding** â€“ not like Wikipedia dumps.  
If I need depth, I dive into trusted blogs, docs, or tutorials. These notes help me **revisit important concepts fast** and **adapt to dynamic work or learning**.
