## Reference Types

- parent reference, child reference
- Reference Type decides which variables are accessible.
- Object Type decides which methods are executed at runtime (polymorphism).
- Variables are shadowed, methods are overridden.

<hr/>

## OOPS Concepts

- **abstraction**
- **encapsulation**
- **inheritance** : single, multilevel, hierarchical, multiple(through interface), hybrid
- **polymorphism** : static compile time (method overloading) , dynamic run time (method overriding)

## Abstract Classes

- concrete class -> general class ex: class Parent {}
- abstract class - uses abstract keyword ex: abstract class Parent {}
- we cannot create an instance(object) of abstract class
- class that extends (inherits) abstract class will also be abstract 
- class to overcome abstract class then every method should be override
- abstract method - method which is not having body (undefined method)
    ex: abstract void meth2();
- abstract class - class that having atleast one abstract method (that means class is also not completely defined)

- abstract class set some standards like ex:
    
```
abstract class Hospital {
  abstract void emergency();
  abstract void appointment();
  abstract void admit();
  abstract void billing();
  ...
} 

class MyHospital extends Hospital {
  MyHospital() {}
  void emergency() {}
  void appointment() {}
  ...
}

Hospital h = new MyHospital();
// we make sure MyHospital only follow the standards that are set by Hospital as it can access the methods only defined in Hospital
```

## Interfaces in Java

- by default every method is abstract 
- classes are extends
- interfaces are implements
- we cannot create object for interface
- In java a class can be exteded only from single class (multiple inheritance is not possible) but in interfances it can implements from so many interfaces
- interface is defined for achieving runtime polymorphism and dynamic method dispatch
- it can have static methods with body

- ex

```
interface Parent1 {
  void meth1();
}

interface Parent2 {
  void meth1();
}
  
class Child1 implements Parent1,Parent2 {
  public void meth1() {
    System.out.println("Child meth2");
  } 
}

public class MyFirst {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    Child1 p = new Child1();
    p.meth1();
  }
}
```
